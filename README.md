# express-exercises-part-1
This repository contains a sequence of exercises that will improve your understanding of routes and the handling of dynamic data. 

## Set-up
- Install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (`npm install -g nodemon`) and use it to start your server (`nodemon server.js`).

## Instructions
When you start to work on the exercises, begin with [hello-param](01-hello-params/README.md) and move down until you reach [students-query](07-hipstafy/README.md).

Inside each directory of an exercise, you'll need to [follow these steps](start-guide.md):

- create a `.gitignore`.
- create a `package.json` (`npm init`).
- install npm modules (`npm install`).
- create a `server.js`.
- require modules in `server.js`.

__Some of the exercises will include the above files, but none of them will install or require npm modules for you. In other words, you'll have to manually install and require modules.__
